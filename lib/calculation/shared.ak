  // Uniqueness check is a bunch of flipped bits, and we want to blow up if we ever set a bit that is ever hit again
  // Imagine for example that uniqueness_flags is b0100_0010
  // Construct a number with the `index`th bit set
  // e.g. if index == 3, then construct b0000_1000
  let bit = small_pow2(index)

  // b0001_0000

  //   b0100_0010
  // + b0000_1000
  // ---------------
  //   b0100_1010
  let flag_set = uniqueness_flags + bit

  // If, however, we were ever to set this again,
  //   b0100_1010
  // + b0000_1000
  // ----------------
  //   b0101_0010
  // Notice there was a carry that happened!
  // We can use the fact that the carry happened to detect that we had a duplicate in the list
  // At this point I was stuck trying to figure out how to calculate that, and
  // @Microproofs figured out the dark incantation to make it work:
  expect flag_set % bit_shifted > uniqueness_flags % bit_shifted

  // Lets take it piece by piece;
  // uniqueness_flags % bit_shifted
  //  - sets all of the bits at or above the `bit_shifted` to 0
  //  - so, basically just masks to the bit we flipped and lower
  //  - in the example above, this is like discarding the high 4 bits
  // flag_set % bit_shifted
  //  - does the same thing, but for the newly set flags
  //
  // So in the above example, the first time through, we get
  // b1010 > b0010  which is true (i.e. setting the flag turned the bit on!)
  // And the second time through, when there's a carry, that bit goes to 0!
  // b0010 > b1010  which is **false**, because we "carried" the one away into the high bits that got masked off
  //
  // So we will have failed if we ever set the same bit twice!
  // We can return the flag set for the next time through the loop
